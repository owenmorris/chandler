This directory contains patches that have been applied to this source
tree which have *not* been applied to the CVS tree (if any.)  Usually
the reason for this is that the change would break the binary
compatibility of a stable branch, or it is something that fixes a
problem that wxPython users are experiencing that has not yet been
agreed to by the rest of the core wxWindows developers.
