Description: This plugin provides support for Google Data synchronization in Chandler.
        
        To download and install the plugin, use Chandler's InstallPlugin script::
        
        InstallPlugin Chandler-gdataPlugin
        
        If you want to work on its code, you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py develop
        
        to install it in development mode (where you can make changes and have them
        take effect whenever Chandler is restarted), or you can use::
        
        RunPython setup.py install
        
        to install it as an ``.egg`` file.
        
        Note that when installed as an egg file, changes made to the source code will
        not affect Chandler execution, until you run ``setup.py install`` or ``setup.py
        develop`` again.
        
        After making changes to this plugin, you should update its version number in
        ``setup.py`` and in the chandler/Makefile, so that people using "quick builds"
        of Chandler will use your new version.
        
        If you want to run this plugin's tests use::
        
        RunPython setup.py test
